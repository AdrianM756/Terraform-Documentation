## Infrastructure as code(IaC)

[Infrastructure as code (IaC)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/) is the ability to provision and support your computing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes and settings.

## Terraform

[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) is a free open-source IaC tool developed by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/en).
